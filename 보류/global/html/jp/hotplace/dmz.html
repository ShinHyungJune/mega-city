										It is a basin located in Haean-myeon, Yanggu-gun, and was named by foreign journalists during the Korean War as it looked like a bowl of flower. This area is currently the only area in Korea where residents reside within the civilian access control line and has a geopolitical peculiarity. In this area, during the Korean War, the punch bowl Battle, the Battle of Dosol Mountain, and the Battle of Gachilbong were fiercely fought, and there are still signs of “landmines” everywhere. It is a place that makes viewers feel tense, although the unusual appearance may arouse curiosity.

									DMZ punch bowl Dulle-gil cannot be explored without being accompanied by a forest trail experience instructor due to the local characteristics. It is a forest path built within the civilian access control line, and is adjacent to an unidentified mine area, where the instructions of the guide must be followed. Nevertheless, the reason why many people visit Dulle-gil here is because it is a place that gives great meaning to us living in the pain that has not yet ended.
								</p>
								<div class="mb-25"></div>
								<p class="body type01">
									The trail is divided into four courses. To briefly explain the course, it is a forest path of peace that takes 14 km one way and takes 4 hours. This course starts from the information center and sees the symbols of the Military Demarcation Line, such as the Wausan Observatory, birch groves, and large bunkers. Here, we can see and feel with our own eyes how valuable the peace we feel in our daily lives.

									<p class="body type01">
										The next is the Oyubat-gil course, which is a one-way 21.12km course that takes about 5 hours. Also starting from the information center, you can explore Dongmak-dong, Oyu Reservoir, Wildflower Park, Songgabong Observatory, DMZ Native Botanical Garden, and prehistoric sites. This course is a natural monument protected area, and you can see traces of various vegetation and wild animals, which are natural monuments, in the Forest Genetic Resource Reserve, as well as a beautiful view of the basin topography.
									</p>
									<div class="mb-25"></div>
									<p class="body type01">
										The longest one way of the course is 21.9Km, which is a bit difficult among the courses. Mandae Village, DMZ Native Botanical Garden, Seonghwangdang, Mandae Reservoir, Gangsong Arboretum, and Munmetjae Forest Trail. The best course is to see the Japanese oak trees that protect Seonghwangdang, and walk the ridges and valleys at the foot of Mt.

										The last is Munmet Jaegil. It is 16.2km one way, but it can be said to be quite a difficult course. It is a course that tours the birch forest, minefield, temporary control post, Arirang Pass, military heliport, Munmet sewing, stopping defense ship, and Mandae field road. When I walk around this place, I think, "I'm really in the DMZ right now." Passing through the minefield road and looking at the temporary control post and defense lines, you can feel the signs of war. However, if you walk along the ridge of Daeamsan Mountain, you can see mountains in the north such as Geumgangsan, Unbong, and Stalingoji, and mountain peaks such as Seoraksan, Jumbongsan, and Hyangrobong that stretch to the south, like a picture.

										Each course has different charms, but the sights you see while walking along the Dulle-gil on all courses are fascinating and make you think a lot. The ecosystem has been well preserved as it has been restricted to the private sector for more than half a century, so people cannot reach it. It will be a wonderful experience to find the uncommon wildlife traces and to see wild plants.
										In addition, the cool, fresh air that you drink while walking along the mountain path lightens the minds of those who walk. As I walk around here and there, it's a mountain path,
										so my breath is full. In order to provide rest to such people, there are also shelters where you can sit and relax in various places on Dulle-gil.

								<div class="right">
									<p class="body type01">
										Whenever you start to breathe a little, pause for a moment, take a deep breath, breathe in the green air from the forest, and watch the natural scenery in front of you. I can feel the good energy filling my body. If you repeat walking and taking a break for a while, people who initially wondered if it would be possible to finish the race will be walking with fun. You can get the energy that nature rewards you as much as you walk and work hard. In particular, the punch bowl terrain, which you can see from the top of a mountain peak, is both beautiful and uncommon, giving you a strange feeling. Because the terrain is hollow under an open mountain, it is easy to understand why this place was engaged during the war.

								As you walk up the mountain path, you can see caution signs that read ‘landmines’ in various places. Unless I see it in the news, I rarely encounter it, so the fact that there is something like this in front of me is both strange and a little scary. However, it is a little sad that there are still traces of war that have passed half a century and there are many landmines that have not been discovered. I feel that it is a ceasefire, not the end of the war, and I look forward to seeing the end of the war one more time that everyone wishes to come.

										However, the place where the war took place is not unfortunate. It may be a dangerous place, as it was rare, but it is also a mysterious place. The wildflower park with wildflowers spreads out like a flower garden from a scene in a movie, making viewers feel thrilled. DMZ Native Botanical Garden is a great place to see various plants.

										Although it is a land with pain, the things made there give people the power to create hope as if a plant sprouts.

										This is the meaning that both DMZ punch bowl circumferences give us.
										<br/>The peace that we normally felt for granted is probably not natural, the traces of many lives in nature that we have never looked around, and we can feel it closest to here. Perhaps the tragedy started with a person, and it is a human job to turn it back and recover. We all know the tragedy we've seen in the path we've taken, and the opposite of peace and beauty. We must leave behind the sadness that has passed and follow the light that unfolds in front of us and the bright energy that Dullegil gives us.

									By the time the Dullegil course is over, I think that everyone who has walked the same path will have the same thoughts in the hearts of everyone from different places. We hope that everyone walks at least once on the DMZ Circumference Road, which creates a special memory that we have never encountered before and presents an experience where we can feel both history and nature in the nearest place.

									In particular, the three courses excluding Munmetjae-gil are particularly good because you can tailor the trekking for only the section of the forest road excluding farm roads by 1 hour.
