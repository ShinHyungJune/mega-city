									<p class="body type01">
										Park Soo-geun was born as the eldest son of a poor family in Yanggu, and had a poor childhood. Contrary to the values of painter Park Soo-geun that we think of now, he has never received art education properly because of the poor family environment. He is responsible for the livelihood of his family and has developed his dream of art by self-education. Park Soo-geun is a painter who devoted his life to drawing “human goodness and truth” based on the life of an unnamed and poor commoner.

									<p class="body type01">
										Perhaps that is why Park's works depict everyday and simple things rather than colorful or abstract ones. Most of them are objects expressed with lines and outlines, indigenous colors consisting of white, grayish brown, and yellowish brown, and techniques that ignore perspective and emphasize contrast. Park Soo-geun's work has a charm that makes viewers comfortable and calm.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="right">
									<p class="body type01">
										He achieved the epitome of Korean beauty by emphasizing the essence of the object by using simple shapes and line drawings, and expressing the Korean national sentiment with rough granite-like texture through Western painting techniques. He, who portrayed the everyday life of our people with a warm gaze, is a popular painter who embodies simple beauty and is considered the most Korean painter of the 20th century.

									<div class="mb-60"></div>

									<p class="body type01">
										Park's works are generally characterized by dark colors and rough textures. The harsh and cold feeling makes the viewers of the painting feel his hard life. In fact, the exterior wall of Park Soo-geun Museum was built with granite. Looking at the wall, it feels rough and hard. As if he expressed it in his work. Painter Park Soo-geun's issue is "Miseok".
									</p>

									<div class="mb-30"></div>

									<p class="body type01">
										It seems to be derived from the beauty of granite, which is often used for towers and tombstones. He sought beauty in the stone and tried to format it. Park Soo-geun tried to realize Korean beauty by expressing the rough texture of the old stone surface. You can feel each and every one of his life from the exterior of the museum.

										Just because he was poor and difficult didn't mean that his life was just cold and dark. At the age of twenty-six, he met Mrs. Kim Bok-soon, Park's life partner. The first place they met was in the laundry, and Park Soo-geun wrote the most true love he could make. “I am a painter. The only property is brushes and palettes. If you agree and marry me, you will suffer materially, but mentally, I am confident that I will make you happier than anyone else. Would you like to be a great painter and you will be a great painter's wife?” This is part of the contents of a letter sent by Park Soo-geun to Ms. Bok-soon Kim. In the writing, I can feel the love and warm heart of Park Soo-geun for Ms. Bok-soon Kim.

								<div class="right">
									<img src="/assets/global/img/art07.jpg" alt="">
									<div class="mb-50"></div>
									<p class="body type01">
										It can be seen that Park Soo-geun, expressed in Kim Bok-soon's diary, is also a person with an extremely warm heart. “When he bought something, he bought it from a streetcar, a handcart, or a basket market rather than from a big store. He always felt pity for the women who shopped in baskets, and always felt pitiful for the neighbors who suffered after the war, so it may be that the subjects of his paintings are all those who do business on the street. ”The above, which is part of Kim Bok-soon's diary, shows where Park Soo-geun’s mind is always heading. He himself could not live a leisurely life, but he was a person who lived with pity for others.
										Even though his life was poor, the warmth of his soul can be felt in his works depicting the people he sees and throughout the museum.

										The biggest attraction of Park Soo-geun Museum is that nature does not exist for the museum, but the “harmony” as if the museum was drawn in nature. As you slowly look around the entire museum, you often come across Park Soo-geun's works. It feels as if we are seeing what he saw and drew together during his lifetime. As I walk surrounded by trees and grass, the painting of Park Soo-geun, his life, and myself melt together in nature.

								As you walk on the road to the Park Soo-geun Mausoleum in the museum, special exhibitions are held in the Park Soo-geun Pavilion and the Museum of Modern Art, with art collections and various subjects, and you can enjoy special exhibitions other than the work of Park Soo-geun. He left his work, but his influence continues to impress many contemporary artists.

								In June of this year, a children's art museum was opened in the Park Soo-geun Museum. Art and cutting-edge technology blend together here. In addition, there are a variety of experience spaces where you can experience Park Soo-geun's childhood stories more intimately and stimulate the five senses of children. Decorated with local artists, this space is not just for children. It is a place where children can enjoy and learn a variety of materials through experience and play, making it easy for parents to understand Park Soo-geun's view of art together.
